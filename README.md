Hi, I’m **Shlok Kamat** — a final-year **Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)** candidate at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, where I specialize in **financial risk analytics**, **healthcare analytics**, and **consumer tech applications**.

As part of my MSBA capstone internship, I joined **EY’s Technology Consulting (AI & Data Team)** in Singapore, where I led **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** for a **public sector GenAI platform** deployed on the **Singapore Government Commercial Cloud (GCC 2.0)**.

I was also a **finalist (Top 8 out of 200+ teams)** in the **NUS-GURU Network AI Innovation Challenge 2025**, and hold the **AFP® (Associate Financial Planner)** designation in Singapore.

Previously, I worked as a **Data Analyst at Arta Finance**, where I:
- Automated **AUM tracking**, saving advisory teams 15+ hours weekly,
- Built a **semantic data layer** to simplify analytics,
- Co-developed a platform powering Arta’s **“Wealth as a Service”** AI suite.

Before graduate school, I was an **Analyst at Bain & Company** (New Delhi), working within the **Performance Improvement Practice**, and completed **product and analytics internships** at:
- **Paisabazaar.com** – built predictive models for credit card limits and disbursals,
- **TransOrg Analytics** – delivered data science solutions for business-critical problems,
- **Spenny (now part of CRED)** – contributed to a **Y-Combinator-backed** micro-savings app.

I graduated **with distinction** in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** from **Shiv Nadar University, India**, where I led national-level design competitions and developed a keen interest in finance.
